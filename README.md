24 AWG Enameled Wire
Heatshrink
Soldering Iron
Solder

Cut an end off and strip back the shielding.  Separate the ground shield from the dielectric insulator and strip that back to the Inner conductor.  You want to tin both tips, it saves you time later and helps the heat shrink not shrink if you're fiddling with it with your heat-shrink in place.  You want your Inner conductor wire to be longer than your ground plane so when soldering they are kind of stepped.  Ill be cutting back the ground shield later

I going to use 24ga magnet wire because i have a ton, but any can be used.  cut enough to make two loops.  Find something Round and wrap your wire.  I used a screwdriver.
